# Vibration-detection
This project is designed to monitor and detect minute vibrations in chemical industry pipelines, ensuring the early detection of potential hazards such as leaks, cracks, and structural weaknesses. The vibration data is sent to ThingSpeak for real-time monitoring and analysis, facilitating proactive maintenance and enhancing operational safety.
